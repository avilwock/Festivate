# Festivate: Celebrations Perfected 
A party planning application. An all-encompassing digital platform that simplifies and streamlines the process of planning, organizing, and managing parties and events. The application aims to assist users in seamlessly handling everything from invitations to venue bookings, catering, and event scheduling, ensuring a memorable and hassle-free experience for both organizers and attendees.

## Final Project - JotGenious
My challenge is to create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real world data to soleve a real-world challenge, with focus on data and user demand. 

## User Story 
```
As a user, I want to register for an account on the event planner application, so that I can create and manage/track events.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

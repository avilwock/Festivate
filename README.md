# Festivate: Celebrations Perfected

A party planning application. An all-encompassing digital platform that simplifies and streamlines the process of planning, organizing, and managing parties and events. This application aims to assist users in seamlessly handling everything from invitations to venue bookings, catering, and event scheduling, ensuring a memorable and hassle-free experience for both organizers and attendees.

Our challenge is to create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real world data to solve a real-world challenge, with focus on data and user demand. 

## User Story 
```
As a user, I want to register for an account on the event planner application, so that I can create and manage/track events.
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN an event planner application
WHEN I open the application.
THEN I am presented with a landing or homepage with a link to the login page or signup page.
WHEN I click on the link to log in or sign up, I am presented with a new page.
THEN I am presented with a log in or sign up option on my screen, plus empty fields to enter my username and password, or sign up.
WHEN I enter my login information, I am taken to my profile.
AT the top of the page after logging in, I am provided with an option to view my profile, and see my events. 
WHEN I click on the Events button,
THEN I am taken to my events page where I can see current events or I can add new events.
WHEN I click on an event, 
THEN I am taken to the individual event where I can see my information, and make edits or delete my event. I can also see a section of tasks associated with this event.
WHEN I click on Add Task, 
THEN I am given a form to fill in a new task and details about that task.
WHEN I select a task, I can edit the task, delete the task, or mark it as completed.
